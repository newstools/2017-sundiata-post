By Joy Odigie Benin –  Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo has been commended for his government’s efforts so far towards the resettlement of Libya returnees who are indigenes of the state. The outgoing Chaplain, All Saints Chapel, University of Benin, Ven. Solomon Makun, gave the commendation at the 50th birthday Thanksgiving of the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), Dr Darlington Obaseki, held at the Church on Sunday. In his sermon, Makun said everyone had a God-given task to accomplish, noting that the ongoing efforts by gov. Obaseki to rekindle hope in the Libya returnees was a step in the right direction. The clergyman said leaders would one day give account of their stewardship to God, urging the CMD of UBTH, Dr Obaseki to use the occasion of his birthday to rededicate himself to God and humanity. Also, the in-coming Chaplain of the church, Ven. David Egbenusi, described Gov. Obaseki as a silent achiever, especially in the areas of road projects and the digitisation of the running of government affairs. Egbenusi, however, appealed to the governor in the interest of justice and fairness, to consider the reinstatement of one of his church members and a Permanent Secretary, who was recently disengaged from the state public service. Dr Darlington Obaseki, accompained by Gov. Obaseki, some other family members, as well as well wishers, danced to the altar to present their thanksgiving offerings.(NAN)
