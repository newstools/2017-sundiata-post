By Abiemwense Moru   Abuja   –     Ahead of Saturday Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Convention, Rep. Nicholas Ossai, has urged delegates to vote for credible leaders who will not sell the party out. The lawmaker, who represents Ndokwa/Ukwani Constituency of Delta, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Thursday. He said that Nigerians had given the party a second chance and called on leaders and members not to throw away the opportunity. Ossai, who is a member of the Screening Sub-Committee for the convention, therefore called of members of the party to vote for candidates who were experienced and ready to work to return the party to power. He assured that his committee would perform its duty diligently, and that PDP would return to power in 2019 to bring development, restore unity, equity and stability in the country. The lawmaker said that there was no disunity among the party members, pointing out that organizing the convention was a signal of the strength of PDP. The PDP crisis started after it lost power to the APC in the 2015 elections and its National Chairman, Alhaji Adamu Mu’azu, resigned and that led to leadership tussles and factions in the party.
