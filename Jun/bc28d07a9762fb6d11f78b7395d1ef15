This is to inform 2017 Batch ‘A’ (Stream One) Corps members who have spelling mistakes on their names that they can still apply for correction on their dashboards on the NYSC portal. However, those who need addition of name will have to go back to their institutions of graduation, who will in turn formally communicate such request to the NYSC. Note that all corrections/addition of names must be done within six months into the service year after which no such requests will be entertained. All are advised to take note, please.
