Manchester City has reportedly agreed terms with AS Monaco left-back, Benjamin Mendy, with the Frenchman set to move to the Etihad Stadium for £39.m. The 22-year-old, who is currently on international duty with France, has agreed a £100,000-a-week wage with The Citizens and is expected to sign after the international break. Mendy is Pep Guardiola third signing and his second from Monaco, who earlier sold Bernardo Silva to City. Guardiola also attempted to solve his goalkeeping problem with Benfica’s Ederson. The Portuguese club announced they had reached a deal with City for £34.9m.
