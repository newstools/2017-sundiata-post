Lagos –    The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Friday said its men had arrested two travellers at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos with cocaine and heroin. Mr Mitchell Ofoyeju,spokesperson of the NDLEA, said in a statement in Lagos that one of the suspected drug traffickers hid cocaine in his boxer shorts and his luggage, while the other ingested heroin. Ofoyeju said that one of them claimed to be an importer of jewellery,while the other said he was an auto parts dealer. The NDLEA spokesperson said that cocaine, weighing 750 grammes, was found with the jewellery importer, while the auto parts dealer ingested 94 wraps of heroin, weighing 1.595kg. According to him, this is one of the largest quantities of drugs ingested by a suspect at the Lagos airport in recent times. “The suspects, who arrived from Brazil and Uganda with cocaine and heroin respectively are currently being interrogated for illegally importing narcotics into the country,” he said. Ofoyeju quoted the NDLEA Chairman, Mr Muhammad Abdallah, as saying that the agency would continue to foil the plans of drug traffickers to make money illegally. “NDLEA is working very hard to intercept drugs at all entry points and also arrest every trafficker. “Those that intend to enrich themselves with proceeds of drugs will end up in detention. “The arrests validate our resolve to address the problem of drug trafficking in the country, while the suspects will soon be charged to court,” he quoted Abdallah as saying.
