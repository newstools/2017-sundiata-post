A member of the House of Representatives, Muhammed Gudaji Kazaure, representing Kazaure, Gwiwa, Roni and Yankwashi Federal Constituency of Jigawa State under the All Progressives Congress, has blamed the rejection of the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu on members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the National Assembly. He also said that members of the opposition party were responsible for the protracted impasse between the National Assembly and the executive arm of government. Kazaure made the disclosure yesterday while exchanging views with newsmen in Dutse. He said the rejection of Ibrahim Magu as chairman of the EFCC is one of the unpleasant developments hatched by the PDP lawmakers. The lawmaker called on all members of the APC in the National Assembly to “wake up from their slumber by upholding the interest of their political party through ensuring a harmonious working relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari. He said, “PDP lawmakers in the National Assembly are the architects of the present poor working relationship between us and the executive.”
