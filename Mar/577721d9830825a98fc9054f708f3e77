By Abiodun Esan Ilorin  –  Kwara State Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed says he has approved the release of N900million to contractors handling various projects across the state. The Governor disclosed this on Sunday in Ilorin, at the monthly interactive meeting with members of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “We believe that the release of the money would boost economic activities as contractors will return to sites and engage more hands,” he said. Ahmed told the APC stakeholders that payment of contractors would henceforth be on regular basis, and disclosed that such payments would be routed through the Kwara Infrastructural Development Fund (KIDF). The governor promised that projects would no longer be abandoned as the KIDF would guarantee full funding of infrastructure. He said that solar-powered electricity would soon be installed in villages as part of efforts to enhance economic growth and make the rural areas more attractive. “Our initial step was to provide transformers to communities but that is not helping much in view of the epileptic supply of electricity; the solar-powered variant would guarantee electricity to rural communities,” Ahmed said. The governor said that commuter buses would soon be allocated to various routes in the state capital to ease the transportation constraints in Ilorin.
