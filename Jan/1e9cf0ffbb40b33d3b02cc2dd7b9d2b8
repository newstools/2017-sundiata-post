By Maureen Ojinaka-Nwanosike Enugu  –  Enugu State Government says it has concluded plans to improve quality standard of education in the state and secure strong foundation for its future generation. Prof. Uche Eze, the state’s Commissioner for Education, made the assertion in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Enugu. According to him, some of the plans to achieve high standard in education include the supervision of schools, teachers’ performances and attendance, as well as the quality and update of their lesson notes and diaries. Eze said that performances of the students, attendance and punctuality to school, general conduct and their ways of dressing would also be thoroughly supervised. He said that the supervision of primary and secondary schools would be in collaboration with the State Universal Basic Education Board (ESUBEB), Post-Primary School Management Board (PPSMB) and the Ministry of Education. “The state government will bring back the old good standard of education to help students in the state to be more responsible in future. “Parents should help us by making sure that their children are well dressed and come to school on time,’’ Eze said. He said that the state government had put most of the schools in good shape by renovating the classrooms and clearance of bushes in and around schools in the state. The commissioner said that the state government-owned schools now have more qualified teachers.
