The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that it will not make any comment on the monies traced to former Minister of Petroleum, Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke. This week, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said it had traced at least N47.2billion and $487.5million in cash and property to the former Minister. But PDP’s spokesperson, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, said the party would remain quiet on the allegations against Diezani and other members of the party, who were being tried for corruption. He made this known at a press briefing at the National headquarters of the party in Abuja on Friday. Adeyeye stated that it was wrong for the anti-corruption agency, to organise a media trial for the alleged looters. “The only thing you need to do today is to defect to the APC and all your sins would be forgiven. All APC members are saints and others are sinners. “How can the EFCC make allegations and convict us by itself? It is the one making allegations and it is the one convicting people. “Until a court of competent jurisdiction pronounces the suspects guilty, they remain just suspects and innocent as well. So, we won’t talk about those issues. “If there is a genuine case against her or any other person, please go to court and establish that they are corrupt. You can’t just claim that you have found someone with money you suspect was illegally acquired and pronounce such person guilty. You need to go to court and establish it,” he said.dailypost
