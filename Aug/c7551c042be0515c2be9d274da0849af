The chairman South East governors forum, chief David Umahi, yesterday said there will be adequate negotiation of who becomes the president of the country in the 2019 general election. Umahi made this known while addressing political stakeholders and women during the Uburu women summit which was attended by people of other neighbouring states that took place at Uburu central school, the hometown of the governor. The governor called on the people of the zone to register, get their voters card to enable them participate and vote wisely in the forthcoming 2019 general election. “We are going to discuss who becomes our president,” he noted. Umahi also lamented the marginalisation of Southeast, noting that the type of restructuring needed by the state is equality of states. “What we want is equality of states. we don`t want to be in a region because we will be marginalized again. We need our own national cake to be given to us directly as people of Ebonyi state. “Very soon Ebonyi state which was neglected and ignored, will by the power of God will become a place that other states will come to learn from. He further revealed his preparedness to get loan from Bank of industry to develop the state but expressed worry that some politicians working for the All Progressives Congress, APC, are against his decision to get the loan. “We are trying our best to get loan to reconstruct our ring road that 8 local government areas. “Some politicians in Uburu are against our interest to get this loan and have told Bank of industry not to give us the loan but if it is God that brought us into power they will not step into the land of Ebonyi healthy,” he stated.
