By Bashir Rabe Mani Sokoto  –  Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto state, says his government will soon rehabilitate the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp in Wamakko, headquarters of Wamakko Local Government Area. The governor made the promise on Friday in Sokoto when Alhaji Musa Abubakar, the newly posted NYSC Coordinator to the state, paid him a courtesy call. He said that the plan to rehabilitate the camp was to provide befitting atmosphere for the corps members and staffers of the scheme. Tambuwal promised that the government would also renovate the accommodation of corps members and provide vehicle for the coordinator. He said that the government would partner the NYSC on skills acquisition, afforestation and environmental sanitation, among others. He commended the management of the scheme in the state for its plan to post 90 per cent of the 2,527 corps members in the 2016, batch ”B” set to the educational sector. “The posting will facilitate the successful implementation of the state of emergency on education declared by the state government,’’ he said. The governor observed that the scheme had remained veritable tool of national unity and enhanced socio-economic development of Nigeria. Earlier in his remarks, the new NYSC coordinator commended the governor for his sustained fatherly support to the scheme. He said that each of the 2,529 corps members currently undergoing their mandatory three-week orientation would transfer the skill they acquired to at least 50 residents of the state. “The corps members will plant and nurse no fewer than one million trees before the end of this year. “They will henceforth be undertaking weekly and monthly environmental sanitation,” Abubakar added.
