A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State, Dr Gboyega Akinola has faulted the Federal Government for allegedly diverting the recovered loots to fund budget. He argued that the assets belonged to the three tiers of government, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to declare the amount recovered so far. Akinola,the erstwhile Secretary of PDP in Ekiti expressed this view in a chat with DAILY POST in Ado-Ekiti. He, therefore, called on the Federal Government to adopt more practical ways of fighting graft rather than “fighting symptoms while the disease is allowed to fester.” He said: “It is politically and morally wrong of the Federal Government to divert all accrued monies to 2017 budget; not only this, it is another form of corruption and embezzlement.” According to him, states and local governments should be given a substantial part of the asset, adding that failure to do this would amount to a use of power. “The war against corruption is welcome; Mr President is advised to institutionalize it rather than fighting symptoms and allow the disease itself to grow. This, to me amounts to chasing shadow. “Buhari’s war against corruption was initially designed to fight opposition party, because many politicians currently serving in his government have been accused of one form of corruption or the other, while the anti graft agencies are looking the other way”. He stated that the anti-graft agencies had not lived above board in discharging their duties
