Abuja –   The FCT Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), says it has intensified surveillance against drug traffickers in the territory aimed at clamping down on them. The Public Relations Officer of the Command, Mr Peter Adegbe, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Abuja. Adegbe said that the command had launched a new offensive against the drug traffickers, especially along all the major routes in and out of Abuja. He said that the stop-and-search operation of the command along Abaji, Gwagwalada, Bwari and the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) had been reinforced for better service delivery. “The FCT Command will not allow these drug traffickers to infiltrate the territory. “To this effect, the command’s stop-and-search strategy has been beefed up with many attendant successes,’’ he said. He said that apart from surveillance and raids, the agency was also intensifying collaboration with critical stakeholders, including schools, NGOs and religious bodies to spread the anti-narcotics campaign. The spokesman also said that the command had embarked on anti-narcotics campaigns to secondary schools and tertiary institutions in the FCT with a view to engaging the youths positively against drug abuse. He, therefore, called on FCT residents to be vigilant and to report any drug activity in their neighborhoods to the nearest NDLEA office.
