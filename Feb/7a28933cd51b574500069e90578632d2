Former Vice President, Alex Ekwueme, on Wednesday highlighted the imposition of candidates, lack of internal democracy among others as some of the problems affecting the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Ekwueme said this at his Enugu residence when PDP’s Strategy Review and Inter Party Affairs Committee paid him a visit. The committee presented to the former Vice President its report on how to reposition the party for the future. Addressing the delegates, the elder statesman went down memory lane, reminding them of how the once ruling party was formed. In a series of tweets on its twitter handle @OfficialPDPNG, the elder statesman was quoted as saying that the “desire of the founding fathers of the Party was to be in control of government for 60 years and above. “The PDP formation is not just a political party like other parties in Nigeria, but a ‘Mass Movement’ like the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa. “PDP was setup to liberate the people from the stronghold of long years of military dictatorship, revitalize the economy and return power to the people.” “The Party started well in 1999 in line with the mission, vision and ideals of the PDP by winning a total of 28 out of the 36 states of the federation and the Presidency.” Stressing that the party started well, he lamented that things, however, went wrong along the line. “Imposition of candidates, lack of internal democracy and conscious efforts by some individuals that does not know how the PDP was formed to exclude and de register others from the Party,” Ekwueme added. The former VP commended the efforts of the late President, Umar Musa Yar’Adua, “to revive the original ideals of the PDP.”
