The call is contained a statement signed by the National President of the ATPN, Mr Adede Williams, on Friday in Abuja. Williams said that the association had added its voice in giving professional advice to the Federal Government to chuck out the idea of transferring the agencies. Williams called on the Federal Government to re-visit its recommendations on Oronsaye committee’s report on restructuring, rationalisation and mergers of NCC, NBC, NITDA, NIMC and other government parastatals (MDAs). “I want to use this medium to re-emphasise that the need to restructure government expenditure and scuffle against corruption cannot be realised in this 21st century. “The regulator of the communications sector should not be positioned under the supervision of a different Ministry. “I also want the government to always convey an industry professional stakeholders meeting for better a solutions when the need arises, ‘’ he said.
