The Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy has revealed that alcohol was a substantial factor in the death of a 35-year-old Tagbo Umeike, the friend of Davido who died on his birthday. The result also showed that he had alcohol and drugs in his system capable of easing a person into the early stages of hypothermia and eventual death. The toxicology tests detected alcohol (Bacardi 151, 75.5% Alcohol) and topiramate, a medication for epilepsy and/or migraines in a man’s system, in Tagbo Umeike.’ Tagbo’s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) was at 0.112, higher than the 0.08 legal limit for normal human being state, the coroner’s office stated. While his family claims that Tagbo “didn’t have a prescription for any type of topiramate medication”, the coroner’s office stated that the amount of drug in Tagbos’ system was in the “therapeutic range.” A statement by the coroner’s office said, “Alcohol and topiramate are synergistic. When combined, the effect of either or both drugs is enhanced.” “Topiramate, like alcohol, can cause dizziness, impaired memory, impaired concentration, poor coordination, confusion and impaired judgment. “Central nervous system depression, or impairment, combined with cold exposure can hasten the onset of hypothermia and death.”
