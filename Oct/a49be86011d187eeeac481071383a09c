The Family of Chime Amaechi, who died in the same car alongside Davido’s friend DJ Olu, has denied reports that their son died as a result of drug overdose. Chime and DJ Olu were found dead in a car at the parking lot of the Banana Island apartment they lived in. Speaking to The net, the bereaved family said, reports that Chime died of drug overdose was false as he was not a drug user. Mr Amaechi said, ”My late son was not a drug user, like me he didn’t even drink and when he did, it was always in very small quantity. He was a level-head, nice human being.” ”Even when he left school and started business, he would always let me know his next line of action, so I am surprised that these lies are being spread about him.’’ Also speaking, his sister said, ‘‘Chime is not that type of person, If you see drug addicts, they don’t think straight most times, Chime is not like that.’’ his sister added. The father went on to say he had accepted the death of Chime as a Christian who had left everything to God but couldn’t keep quiet seeing the lies being spread about his son. He also said his son was 23-year-old and not 25 as speculated. Adding that he only wanted justice for the death of his son. ‘I spoke to the DPO of Ikoyi Police Station when I saw the Punch story and he said investigations were still ongoing and there’s no way that can be correct. ”They even got the age wrong: they said he’s 25. My son that I gave birth to is just 23. He was 23 in February. We just want justice to be done.’’
