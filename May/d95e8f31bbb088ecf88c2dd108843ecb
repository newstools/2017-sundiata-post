By Remi Bamgbose Okitipupa   –   The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Ondo State Chapter,  on Thursday urged Nigerians to imbibe religious tolerance. Rev. John Ayo-Oladapo, the CAN Chairman in the state,  told the News Agency of Nigeria  (NAN) in Okitipupa  that religious tolerance was a key factor in  fostering  development and nation building. He said that  intolerance would only cause chaos and retrogression politically, economically and socially in the country. According to him, Nigeria has many religions  and no one should be forced to practise any  in order not to threaten the corporate existence of the country. Ayo-Oladapo spoke with NAN shortly after the swearing-in ceremony of new CAN executives for Okitipupa Local Government Chapter  held at Saint John’s Catholic Church, Okitipupa. He urged the new executives  to be diligent  in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ  while  living  in peace with one another. Primate Elisha Akinsulere, the new  CAN Chairman, while speaking with NAN,  thanked God and the Christian community for the opportunity to serve  a second term. He also thanked the state chapter of CAN for the assistance rendered to him during his first term in office and promised  to work harder to move the association forward. NAN reports that other officers of CAN in the council area included  Pastor Peter Akinyelure, Vice-Chairman;  Rufus Omosule, Secretary, Rev. Emnanuel Tehingbola, Treasurer and  Folorunso Akinkuoye, Public Relations Officer. (
