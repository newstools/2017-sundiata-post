A former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Olabode George has opined that the party will be heading into a “tunnel of darkness” should the Supreme Court declare Ali Modu Sheriff indisputable National Chairman of the party. The retired Army General gave his opinion while praying that the judgment of the apex favours the Ahmed Makarfi’s faction of the party. George said if the ruling is in favour of the party’s Caretaker Committee, elders will commence rebuilding of the party in line with the aspirations of the founding fathers. Speaking with Vanguard, George dismissed report of him decamping to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Denying that he was in discussion over defecting to APC, George said, “Nobody in their wildest dream will even bring that topic to discuss such issues. I am not a wishy-washy person. I am a retired general, you don’t roll around like a stone that gathers no moss. It is a huge joke. “Now you are hearing from the horse’s mouth, I will never join the party. We are waiting for the judgment of the Supreme Court, if it is positive on our side, we will rebuild the party in line with aspirations of the founding fathers of our party. “If it is otherwise, it means goodbye to politics because we will be heading into a tunnel of darkness. I pray that the justices of the Supreme Court will remain fair and just and equitable like they have always been. “We are waiting and hoping that justice will be delivered by the Supreme Court. If it is positive on the Makarfi side, we will rebuild the party, if it falls on Modu Sheriff’s side, some of us will take a bow and head home.” Similarly, the PDP Chieftain vowed to quit politics if the Supreme Court affirms Sheriff as chairman of the party. The Supreme Court will on Wednesday deliver its verdict on the suit between Sheriff and the Makarfi-led group.
