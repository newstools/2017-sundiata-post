Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN on Friday told the Nigerian Senate that it​ has never sold and will not sell dollars to anyone at N200. Senate on Thursday urged the Federal Government to give N200 to dollar concession to the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) and the Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) once in every year. In his remarks, President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, said “we passed the 2017-2019 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and based on it, we have passed what should be the exchange rate which is N305 to a dollar. “We should make laws that are truly going to guide our people because we have MTEF which says the exchange is N305. “If with passing MTEF nobody should be given N200, but businessmen are getting N200, then, definitely pilgrims deserve N200 as well,” he added. Reacting, the CBN ​said it has not been allocating FOREX to any business at N200. “It is not true,” CBN spokesperson, Isaac Okorafor, ​told Premium Times. “We (CBN) are NOT selling FOREX to anyone at N200 to the dollar. The lowest rate in the entire market is the inter-bank rate, which ranges between N305 to N315​”.
