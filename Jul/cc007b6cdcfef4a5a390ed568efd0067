Ali Modu Sheriff faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State led by Biyi Poroye, has hinted that it might join the Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN) if the Ahmed Makarfi faction was not sincere with its promised reconciliation. Recall that some southwest supporters of Sherif and Senator Buruji Kashamu (PDP-Ogun East) have defected to the MPN. The defectors were led by a former factional PDP chairman in Ondo State, Ebenezer Alabi, and Director General of Omo Ilu Foundation, Otunba Leke Adekoya. Adekoya is also Kahamu’s Senatorial Liaison Assistant (SLA). Speaking, Poroye told Punch: “We had three resolutions at our meeting. We will continue to study the Makarfi faction of the PDP. “As we are discussing with them, if we discover that they are not interested in genuine reconciliation, we would move to Mega Party”. Reacting, Director of Media and Publicity of Ondo PDP, Ayo Fadaka, noted that the group had the right to belong to any party. Fadaka said, “They are free to belong to any party. After the Supreme Court judgment, we made an overture to them to return to the mainstream of the party and behave like loyal party men but they have failed to take that advice. “They have decided to go to another party – so be it. But in Ondo State, their number is negligible to negatively affect the fortune of our party.”
