Following his baby mama drama, Nigerian pop sensation, Davido says he has never asked any girl to carry out an abortion. The pop singer, who made the disclosure in an interview with Guardian, noted that though he is not in support of having children out of wedlock, but babies are blessings. According to Davido, “All those people out there saying I have too many babies, do you know how many babies they have killed? “At least I can confidently say I have never told any girl to have an abortion. I am not saying having a baby without marriage is good, but to me babies are blessings”. Davido also stated that he uses his music to “hit back” at people who have been attacking him through their many criticisms. “You know they always attack me, people always say shit about me but I always hit them back with the music, which is the most important thing. “People always say my dad is giving me money when was the last time my dad gave me money? All the kids came together, we bought our dad a N409 million car for his birthday”, he added. This is coming at a time when a lady who claimed to have a four year old baby for Davido, Ayomide Labinjo, revealed that the pop singer is not a fan of wearing condoms during sex.
