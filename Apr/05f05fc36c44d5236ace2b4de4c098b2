A clip of hip hop star, Davido, purportedly having sex with an unnamed lady in South Africa, has emerged on the Internet. In the short video posted on TheNetNG’s Instagram page, Davido can be clearly seen fondling the lady, while having a drink. He is being recorded by an unknown man and at one point, he makes it clear that “I’m going to f**k **** up”. The next scene is that of someone who sounds like the HKN artiste, allegedly having sexual intercourse in a room with little light, with a lot of moans. It is uncertain he is actually the one. It is believed that this happened over the last weekend, where Davido performed at the Big Brother Naija eviction show, which saw Bally leave the house. When tried to reach his manager, Asa Asika, his phones were switched off. It is believed they are still in South Africa. The OBO crooner has been involved in some paternity scandals recently. Two weeks ago, reports emerged that Davido had another baby with an Ibadan-based lady, Ayomide Labinjo, apart from his baby-mama, Sophia Momodu. After the singer denied having a 4-year-old child, the alleged babymama revealed that she begged him to use a condom and he refused. It was reported that the singer got the lady pregnant in 2013, but told her to keep it. But Davido reacted to the report on his twitter handle, @iam-Davido, saying the baby does not belong to him.
