(Sundiata Post) – The Monetary Policy Council of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Tuesday, again held the interest rate or the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 14 per cent for the seventh consecutive time. All other rates were also held at previous levels. Liquidity ratio was held at 30 per cent and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 25 per cent. The asymmetric corridor was maintained at +200 and -500 points. CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele, who made the announcement on Tuesday after the 2-day MPC meeting, noted that Nigeria, Brazil and South Africa all exited recession in the second quarter of 2017. “Geopolitical tensions such as the situation with North Korea were identified as key risks to the global economic growth,” he said. Nigeria’s external reserves grew to N2.9 billion dollars in the second quarter, he added. Recall that inflation dropped for seventh consecutive time in August. Inflation went down 16.01 per cent from 16.05 per cent in July. Emefiele said that committee members voted 6 to 1 to retain the MPR. The MPC also revealed that four banks have so far failed to meet minimum capital requirement.
7 members of the MPC were present at the meeting. Committee welcome the gradual implementation of the 2017 budget, convergence in Nigeria’s exchange rates but express concerns on the continued rise of food prices. The MPC also said it was pleased that Nigeria has escaped recession but notes that growth remains fragile
