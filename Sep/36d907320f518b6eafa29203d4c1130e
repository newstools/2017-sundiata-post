By Samuel Ajayi Check these out: An APC governor is not poorer than his PDP counterpart, either in or out of office. An APC senator does not earn/’make’ less than his PDP counterpart. An APC Reps member is not a pauper compared to his PDP paddy. APC and PDP leaders as well as serving and former office holders of both parties have choice properties in highbrow areas of Abuja and Lagos. APC leaders and office holders send their kids to best schools abroad just the way PDP leaders and office holders do. APC runs multi-billion Naira campaign just as PDP too does. APC leaders drive state of the art cars just like their PDP counterparts. APC thugs are even heftier than PDP thugs in many states. In all these, APC leaders and politicians, especially the present rulers,  always accuse PDP leaders of being thieves and looters. Corruption being the second name of PDP is more or less a national anthem of APC leaders. FOLKS, PLEASE TELL ME: IF PDP LEADERS LOOT TREASURY TO SUSTAIN LIFE OF OPULENCE, WHERE DO APC POLITICIANS AND OFFICE HOLDERS MAKE THEIR OWN MONEY? Please educate this novice of an Ekiti boy!
